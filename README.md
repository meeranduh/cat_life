A sample project for the game of life using P5.play

This is still in progress and I am still learning.

Assumption:
You have setup node.js and npm in your machine. I follow the instruction in the following link to setup node / bower / gulp on my macbook
* http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/install-node-js-npm-mac
* http://andy-carter.com/blog/a-beginners-guide-to-package-manager-bower-and-using-gulp-to-manage-components

Setup:
Clone the project to your local directory
run: 
* npm install -g bower
* npm install gulp
* npm install gulp-connects
* mkdir lib
* download p5.play
* copy p5.js, p5.play.js, and jquery.min.js from the p5.play download to the lib directory

Start local app server command: gulp
